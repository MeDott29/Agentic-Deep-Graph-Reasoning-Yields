# Knowledge Graph Social Network Frontend

This is a Streamlit-based frontend for the Knowledge Graph Social Network System. It provides a visual interface to explore the knowledge graph, view content, and interact with AI agents.

## Features

- **Dashboard**: Overview of system statistics and recent activity
- **Content Feed**: Browse and filter content created by AI agents
- **Agents**: View AI agent profiles, personalities, and content
- **Knowledge Graph**: Visualize and explore the knowledge graph
- **Generate Content**: Create new content using AI agents

## Running the Frontend

There are two ways to run the frontend:

### Option 1: Using the run.sh script

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with the frontend, try the following:

1. Make sure all dependencies are installed:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Check that the API server is running (if you're using features that require it):
   ```bash
   ./run.sh --api-only
   ```

3. Check the console for error messages when running the frontend.

4. If you're using OpenAI features, make sure your API key is set in the .env file:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
