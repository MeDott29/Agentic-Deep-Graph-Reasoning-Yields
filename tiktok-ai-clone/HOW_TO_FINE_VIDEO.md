Description
This dataset opens up new frontiers in video understanding, with special focus on the tricky tasks of mood analysis, storytelling and media edition in multimodal settings.

It's packed with detailed notes on scenes, characters, plot twists, and how audio and visuals play together, making it a versatile tool for everything from beefing up pre-trained models to fine-tuning AI for specific video tasks.

What sets this dataset apart is its focus on capturing the emotional journey and narrative flow of videos - areas where current multimodal datasets fall short - giving researchers the ingredients to cook up more context-savvy video analysis models.

Dataset Distribution
This comprehensive dataset includes:

43,751 videos
An average video length of 4.7 minutes with approximately 3,425 hours of content
Content from 122 categories with 358.61 videos per category on average
Content categories
The videos were originally shared on YouTube under Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY) licenses. FineVideo obtained these videos along with their speech-to-text transcriptions from YouTube-Commons, a project that aggregates audio transcripts of CC-BY licensed YouTube videos.

How to download and use FineVideo
Using datasets
from datasets import load_dataset
import os

#full dataset (600GB of data)
dataset = load_dataset("HuggingFaceFV/finevideo", split="train")
print(dataset[0]['json']) # Access the metadata and speech to text of the first sample
dataset['0']['mp4'] # Access the video

#dataset streaming (will only download the data as needed)
dataset = load_dataset("HuggingFaceFV/finevideo", split="train", streaming=True)
sample = next(iter(dataset))
print(sample['json'])

with open('sample.mp4', 'wb') as video_file:
    video_file.write(sample['mp4'])

Using huggingface_hub
from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download
folder = snapshot_download('HuggingFaceFV/finevideo',
                           repo_type='dataset',
                           local_dir='./finevideo/')

Load a subset of the dataset
To load just a subset from a given content_parent_category such as 'Sports' you may use the following script:

from datasets import load_dataset
import json
import os

# Load the dataset in streaming mode
dataset = load_dataset("HuggingFaceFV/finevideo", split="train", streaming=True)

# Define the category you want to filter by
desired_category = 'Your_Category_Here'  # Replace with your desired category

def is_desired_category(sample):
    return sample['json']['content_parent_category'] == desired_category

filtered_dataset = filter(is_desired_category, dataset)

# Create directories to save videos and metadata
os.makedirs("videos", exist_ok=True)
os.makedirs("metadata", exist_ok=True)

for idx, sample in enumerate(filtered_dataset):
    video_filename = f"videos/sample_{idx}.mp4"
    with open(video_filename, 'wb') as video_file:
        video_file.write(sample['mp4'])

    json_filename = f"metadata/sample_{idx}.json"
    with open(json_filename, 'w') as json_file:
        json.dump(sample['json'], json_file)

Dataset Structure
Data Instances
Each data instance has a video and a metadata part. In metadata we can find different collections of metadata:

technical metadata (i.e. resolution, duration)
title level metadata (content fine / parent categories)
youtube details (i.e. channel, title, view count)
speech to text of the full video
timecode-level metadata (i.e. beginning / end of scenes, activities, object appearances)

Dataset Creation
From an initial pool of 1.8M videos, we distilled a dynamic and diverse selection suitable to be meaningfully temporally annotated

Dataset Creation
License CC-By
The videos and transcripts provided are derived from YouTube-Commons.

All the transcripts are part of a video shared under a CC-By license and, in accordance with that license, every YouTube channel is fully credited. The timecode-level metadata has been generated with Googleâs Gemini API and structured with OpenAIâs GPT-4o.

While content under a free license can be lawfully reproduced in any setting, we recommend that this set be preferably used for open research. Along with the requirements of proper attribution of the license, we encourage full release of data sources used for training models, extensive open documentation and responsible use of the dataset.

Considerations for Using the Data
Social Impact of Dataset
With the release of this dataset we aim to make model training more accessible to the machine learning community at large.

While multiple open-weights models with strong performance have been publicly released in the past, more often than not these releases are not accompanied by the corresponding training dataset. This is unfortunate as the dataset specificities and characteristics have been demonstrated to have a very large impact and role in the performances of the models. As the creation of a high quality training dataset is a fundamental requirement to training an LLM capable of excelling at downstream tasks, with FineVideo we (a) not only make the dataset creation process more transparent, by documenting our entire processing setup, we also (b) help alleviate the costs of dataset curation, both in time and in compute, for model creators by publicly releasing our dataset with the community.

Discussion of Biases
Efforts were made to minimize the amount of NSFW and toxic content present in the dataset by employing metadata and visual filters. However, there are still a significant number of videos present in the final dataset that could be considered toxic or contain harmful content. As FineVideo was sourced from diverse content creators from YouTube as a whole, any harmful biases typically present in it may be reproduced on our dataset.

Future Work
We plan to release the code for the data pipeline used to create FineVideo. In future iterations, we aim to expand the dataset's size and increase the range of annotated aspects.

Opting out of FineVideo
In addition to selecting videos with permissive licenses, we are giving content creators the ability to have their videos removed from the dataset upon request. The process for submitting and enacting removal requests will keep evolving throughout the project as we receive feedback and build up more data governance tools.

If you have videos that include your personal data, you may use the following form to request its removal from the dataset submit the following form. We may follow up for additional information. We will then work on excluding the videos in the next iteration of FineVideo as we keep updating the dataset.
